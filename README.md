## My Thesis Presentation Video link: https://youtu.be/OKGWRWZqmqg

### RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1. Will the majority of sentiments about digital and robot pet companions be positive or be negative?
2. Does location influence people's sentiments towards digital and robot pet companions?

### ABSTRACT
1. Compared different machine learning models for sentiment analysis on a labeled dataset with the purpose of finding the best performance model.
2. Collect an unlabeled Twitter public dataset about digital robot companions from various regions and use the best model with the purpose of finding the most sentiments in the unlabeled dataset. 
3. Perform a Chi-square test with the purpose of finding dependencies between sentiment and locations.

### METHODOLOGY
The methodology for this study will be a combination of approaches, including:
1. An experimental approach for comparing several models' performance and model selection based on the best performance.
2. A quantitative approach for data collection, sentiment analysis, and hypothesis testing.

### PERFORMANCE EVALUATION & MODEL SELECTION

Linear SVC                           0.883

BertForSequenceClassification        0.970


### RESULT INTERPRETATION
1. Based on the calculated sentiment proportions, all continents have strong positive sentiments. Europe has the highest positive sentiment (63.2%), America (62.6%), Australia (59.1%), and Asia (54.7%).
2. The Chi-Square test supports the null hypothesis of independence.It means that location is not a significant factor in determining which continent is best for AI robot digital companion company marketing.

### RESEARCH QUESTION'S ANSWERS:
1. Will the majority sentiments about digital and robot pet companions be positive, or be negative?
The predominant sentiment about digital and robot pet companions is "joyâ€œ, as a positive sentiment.

2. Does location or region influence people's sentiments towards digital and robot pet companions?
NO. People's sentiments towards digital and robot pet companions are not influenced by their location or region.

### LIMITATION
1. Tweets are collected without regard to age, gender, ethnicity, or culture.
2. Collect only tweets written in English. This might not represent non-English tweets.
3. Machine learning models include flaws and biases, inaccuracy, and mistakes (e.g., irony, sarcasm, or negation).
4. The sample size of tweets collected from Africa was too small and insufficient to be evaluated.

### SUMMARY
1. BertForSequenceClassification model performed exceptionally well in sentiment classification. Therefore, this model was chosen as the best model for further analysis.
2. The sentiment analysis results on unlabeled data from various continents indicated more positive sentiments, such as joy.
3.The hypothesis testing using the chi-square test showed no significant continentsentiment relationships. Therefore, location does not affect people's sentiments towards digital and robot pet companions.

### RECOMMENDATION FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
1. Future research should include age, gender, ethnicity, and culture, to increase sentiment analysis diversity across groups.
2. Future research should include tweets in different languages other than English.
3. Future research should try other machine learning models.
4. Future research should gather a larger sample from Africa.
