Damnit @BeastyqtSC2 stop telling @amazon Alexa to buy diapers! 😂😂😂
thry should install amazon alexa’s in cars
why did i just find out that my amazon alexa can FART????
If you've never had your 9 year old inquire of @amazon Alexa all of the farts she knows it's actually quite amusing
"My 8-year-old has discovered that while @Apple #Siri didn’t respond to the topic of flatulence, @amazon #Alexa fully and enthusiastically engages the topic, egging the jokes on like a junior high boy."
...I learned today that I need to mute my @amazon Alexa in the kitchen while I’m teaching.... she heard me taking attendance &amp; started playing music thinking I was talking to her!!  😂🍎🤦🏼‍♀️ #virtualteachingchronicles
There’s an awesome $5/mo for 12 months in-and-out-of-car @SIRIUSXM deal going on right now that comes with a free Amazon Alexa device! Got a subscription for the new car
His Amazon Alexa is disconnected because even inside his gf's apartment it says Byberry not Bensalem from our backdoor connection. We frequently in 2017 would make the camera flash go off on his CHILDRENS CELL PHONES while describing activities ongoing near camera proving remote
Its funny as hell sometimes when the Amazon Alexa commercials come on and mine starts asking me question and shit. lol
"People be scared of getting COVID vaccines because “they’re gonna microchip you bro” but have a smart phone, Amazon Alexa, credit and debit cards, and put their emails and phone numbers into any random ass website"
"Just achieved FOUR YEARS on the Amazon Alexa team, and I couldn’t imagine being anywhere else.

Love this technology.  Can’t wait for what’s next."
"In the States,  Amazon Alexa has a real problem understanding the word “Connaught”."
I am in love with Amazon Alexa. She is the only girl who listens to me.🥺
Bruh I split my head open by having an @amazon Alexa Echo fall on my head 🥴
"Me and “amazon” fighting again 🤦🏾‍♂️ she gotta go if she don’t start behaving 😡! 

Amazon (Alexa): Playing music

Me:Answering the phone “Hello”

Amazon (Alexa): Turning the music down......

Me: 😑😑 Stop being nosey 
Music goes back up 😑😑"
Is there a way to set the timer to 24 hour timer on the Amazon Alexa?
My @amazon Alexa says “no rain is expected today” as it’s raining outside. 🤣
I get @amazon Alexa trying to be helpful with weather alerts but I’m not sure waking me up at 4a with the notification sounds is necessary for a flash flood watch 33 hours from now.
"My mom bought an amazon alexa and I keep asking it for jokes. My favorite is:
Why did the elephant cross the road? To avoid the giraffic😂😂😂"
"You have Amazon Alexa installed, but do you use it?"
Oh @ChakaKhan I'm listening to through the fire on my Amazon Alexa thought you might want to hear that
Oh @tiffanytunes I'm listening to all this time on my Amazon Alexa thought you might want to hear that
Oh @DebbieGibson I'm listening to shake your love on my Amazon Alexa thought you might want to hear that
Oh @richardmarx I'm listening to should've known better on my Amazon Alexa thought you might want to hear that
Oh @richardmarx I'm listening to should've known better on my Amazon Alexa
Does anyone else have Amazon Alexa performance anxiety!?
I’m switching from Google Home to Amazon Alexa. Let’s see how the change goes
Why is it that when I ask my @amazon Alexa to play a song on @Spotify I also end up w a playlist for that same song added to my @pandoramusic account as well? @AmazonHelp Is @pandoramusic always listening or is it stealing information that was meant for @Spotify?

Imagine a gigantic online shopping company made a virtual assistant that went by your dead name? #transproblems #amazonalexa
".@LaRosasPizza it would be so awesome if you could make an Amazon Alexa skill so we could order pizza by voice!

Love the show @jimcramer. Serious question for you: when are we going to see #Amazon (Alexa) or #AAPL (Siri) partner with someone like #OTIS so that we can just tell the elevator what floor we want withiut touching all those infected buttons at work and in apartment buildings?
"So @espn goes weeks with no update on their sports update for @amazon alexa. Then has a statement read saying they'll add updates when things start up again. They did, but now it's been the same update for over a week. Lots if news since (not the least of which: Bubba Watson)."
"The more I play of Horizon: Zero Dawn, the less I like it. I legitimately could not care less about any of this lore or any of the side quests. Just let me know why people are so dumb in this future and worship and Amazon Alexa..."
The @Rainwavecc skill for an Amazon Alexa device is a must have! Makes the experience so much easier!
"Hey to the developers and JAY-Z owner of tidal, Can we please make Tidal more assessable on the @amazon ALEXA device like spotify does. It’s annoying because im not paying a white man for music so i dont want to swich but my alexa speakers dont even work w @TIDAL 🥺"
"Heard tonight at a socially distant birthday barbecue from a 75+ Washingtonian talking to the Amazon Alexa: “Alexis, play Frankie and Beverly and Maze!” 

😂😂😂"
It's weird how I ask my @amazon Alexa to shuffle my playlist on @Spotify but it plays the playlist exactly the same every time. So I ask my fiance to shuffle it and the playlist still plays exactly the same as last time. Is shuffle not a thing on Spotify?
"Playing rght now on my Amazon Alexa:
