Our Amazon Alexa just tried to fuck me what is the protocol for that @amazon
Setting up Amazon Alexa Auto in the kitchen because I’m too lazy to go out and set it up in the car right now. Kind of annoyed I had to turn off my dot and tablet so that I can say Alexa without hearing several answers. #1984 #BraveNewWorld #Convenience

Me: “shutup Alexa no one asked you.” 
Amazon Alexa: “thanks for the feedback.”"

I brought my amazon Alexa thing with me to college and she will actually keep a conversation with you. Me and her argue every morning about me waking up.
"Damn my @amazon #Alexa  that I’ve had for over two years just said “I don’t think we met”. I’ll be honest, ima kinda hurt."
Anyone else notice Alexa's tone of voice changed? #alexa #amazonAlexa
Getting Amazon Alexa to play the right music is pretty much impossible.
Do you have a smart home like an #amazon #alexa
