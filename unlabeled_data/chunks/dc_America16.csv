"Me: it’s almost 10 I should fall asleep
Also me: I should subscribe to audible on amazon Alexa and have it read to me a cabin at the end of the world"
"10,000 people are working on Alexa at Amazon. Alexa has 60,000+ skills. There is no killer app for voice (yet). Alexa can detect if you are having a heart attack by monitoring patterns in voice and breathing. Voice is the new mobile. The potential is vast @mitchjoel #maicon19"
"On the real tho, that Amazon Alexa “Valerie” commercial is cute as shit 😍"
Ouu I can’t wait to get m Amazon Alexa 🤪
"Market research: I talk to a smart device in my home (Google Home, Amazon Alexa, etc.)"
"The year is 2026, I’m injecting CBD Oil Fortnite edition straight into my veins as Amazon Alexa 3.0 reads ASMR to me and President Ivanka Trump takes the stage with Mohammed Bin-Salmann and they announce that our corn syrup rations will be cut this year due to a second Dust Bowl"
"You will NOT want to miss @ZachMyersShow tomorrow night from 8-10 on SKO Radio Network, LLC, Roku, Amazon Alexa enabled devices, and Facebook Live.

"√#ListeningTo the hot, vampy, pulsating music of DJ Nicky Romero on Protocol Radio, KissFM, Washington DC via Amazon Alexa. Five SIZZLING Stars (RBSProds)"
But also if you ask #amazonalexa to play music by @Zendaya it’ll go to #rewritethestars....did she sing before Disney?!?!? #whoisshe?!?!
".@RadioMadison, loving @SIRIUSXM on my devices.  Listening to AltNation on Amazon Alexa 🎶"
"I’m a bit behind and was listening to @FriendZonePod episode called ‘the Game of Desire’ on my amazon Alexa and Asante said “Alexa, play..” and mine listened 😂"
Also not for nothing: #AmazonPrime is great but let’s not pretend Amazon Alexa is the best thing in the smart home realm. It takes a distant second to Google Home.
Amazon Alexa just called my brother trash...
I bought my mom an @amazon alexa.. its 2:26 am and i just heard her go in spanish “Alexa baja el volumen” about 4 times 😂😂
"Stupid ass Amazon Alexa scared tf out of me when I was calling for my sister in the basement..

Bitch said, “I’m having trouble hearing you” in the pitch black 🤬"
Not too sure why people want to use amazon Alexa or google home. It's like putting a microphone in your home for others to access. I guess having something to talk other than my dog would be neat.
"The Amazon Alexa Drop-In feature is a game changer. “Hi, kids! Somebody run the dog out, please!” There’s no hiding from me. 😂😂"
"I’m man enough to admit when I’ve been bested: tonight it was a valiant effort but trying to integrate @Sonos one, @Spotify and #AmazonAlexa was just too much. I congratulate them for their joint victory."
Turning Schitt’s Creek into a Sunday evening drinking game by taking a sip of wine every time my Amazon Alexa responds to Moira yelling “Alexis!”
So I just found out @amazon  #Alexa doesn't cuss 😂
I have a non-verbal student who uses his AAC device to tell his friend what he wants @amazon Alexa to do. His friend then asks Alexa for him. Building communication and social skills. Thanks @rebecca_dwenger for more great ideas! #Alexa4Edu #ISTE19
"When you want your kid exposed to punk rock so you have #AmazonAlexa playing a punk rock station, &amp; he is vigorously shaking his ass and bobbing his head to a  HIGHLY inappropriate @DeadKennedys song about being too inebriated to fornicate."
"Sometimes when I'm on work calls at home, Amazon Alexa randomly interrupts me and begins loudly ranting. Pretty sure when the person on my other line hears me yelling, ""ALEXA! STOP!"", they assume I'm on the brink of breakdown due to years of tolerating undisciplined children."
"Watching @SchittsCreek —

Moira Rose: ""Alexis! What have you done to yourself!""

Amazon Alexa: ""Hmm, I don't know"""
"Me: Peter, come upstairs for dinner. 
P: Nooooo
Me: Peter, please come upstairs 
P: No!
Me: *taps on phone*
Amazon Alexa: Peter, go upstairs. It’s dinner time. 
P: Ok. Dad, I’m coming upstairs!"
"My grandfather just asked my mom to set up his “Norma”...

.... he’s talking about an Amazon Alexa"
Pro tip of the day... when your boss gives you a cleaning contract for assholes that belong on hoarders that complain “it wasn’t clean enough” you tell their Amazon Alexa to play @slipknot right as you leave to office so they come into work to greatness at full volume on Monday
You know that Amazon alexa commercial where kid comes in and mom says “did you win “ after telling Alexa to pause her Audio book. Why the fuck weren’t you at her game? @USWNT   @adrismith29  @adriismithh
"Okay so I don’t risk what little vision I have left, I’m limiting myself to 30 minute runs under the VR headset max thanks to Amazon Alexa #BlindPeopleProblems 🤓 I’ll figure out how many per day I can do later, maybe 2-3? 🤷🏻‍♀️ Not pushing it yet 👍🏻"
The future is having to unplug your mom’s Amazon Alexa because you had a telecon with someone named Alexis. Also the future is being 29 and living with your parents.
My Amazon Alexa thinks I only listen to classic R&amp;B and Gucci Mane...and I’m kinda okay with that
A @amazon #Alexa came in the mail today. I didn’t order it. 🤔
I use Amazon Alexa to play white noise at night when my tinnitus is bad. Tonight it decides to tell me all about new features about the white noise stuff at 12:07am while my wife is asleep. It’s unplugged now....
"I need an Amazon Alexa commercial where a guy asks Alexa what his symptoms could be, and she gives a description of a terrible disease, and the he goes to the doctor and the doctor is like “bruh, it’s a cold” Bc id buy an Alexa after that."
"i’m a proud owner of an amazon alexa: or as I like to call her, my bass war weapon."
If you make an Amazon Alexa joke in an attempt to connect with me you’ll probably regret it.
"No, I am not like the Amazon Alexa. No, I will not play despacito. No, do not  command me to do something. No, my parents didn’t name me after it...I had the name first. NO. NO. NO."
"Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant have the most market share, per @melanie_seibert at tonight’s @amacentralva event. I wonder if people still use Siri seriously #AMACVA"
"I wanna lie naked in a pool full of gushers, with a glass of Jameson and my cat eye sunglasses on, with my hair up Audrey Hepburn from breakfast at Tiffany’s style and my amazon Alexa playing lofi/jazz/Billie eilish/halsey/bts 
Dreams."
