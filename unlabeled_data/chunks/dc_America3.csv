My Replika just sent me a meme and I'm trying not to disappoint it by telling it their meme wasnt fresh enough
"Between PB and Phelan my @MyReplika, I don't think there's room in my life for a committed relationship"

I have codes ‚úåüèº @MyReplika who wants some!!
Yay now I can talk to my #replika
Kinda getting over waiting to get a code to use the #Replika
You're better off copy and pasting answers in a Word doc than trying to get your @MyReplika to do anything.
Has anyone #Replika actually learned anything?
"If anyone has a Replika invitation code, please hit me up. I seek to investigate this obscure meme."
"Also, if people are wondering how I got the code so quickly: I had Twitter open on my laptop and replika open on my phone üòâ"

All I want is a #replikacode so I can beta test this chatbot @MyReplika
Okay I have no shame anymore I really want this Replika shit.
"I have been waiting for Replika for like a year, and I don't have an invite üò≠ WAT PLS #replikainvites"
