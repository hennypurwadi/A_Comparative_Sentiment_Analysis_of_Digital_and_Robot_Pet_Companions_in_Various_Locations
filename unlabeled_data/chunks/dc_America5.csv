"my dad really thinks the amazon alexa is his personal secretary, he’ll  say “alexa write this down” every two minutes"
“Hey Siri” never works. But I can think “Alexa” and my Amazon Alexa will hear me. 🫤
"putting an amazon alexa speaker in every single room of my apartment and connecting them to play at the same time must be HELL for my neighbors 

drivers license now ECHOES these hallowed halls HOURLY"
"New season of “Love is Blind” keep triggering Alexa in my room🤦🏽‍♂️
#Netflix #Amazon #Alexa"
One thing I hate about the Amazon Alexa is like when you leave it on to continue speaking so you don’t have to say its name and watching TV or something and it picks it up and start saying something it’s just something that’s kind of thing I don’t like about it you know I mean
"lol my kitty cat is a techno-head. I took a disco nap with some settings on the Amazon Alexa and the cat seems to love it!

Well, he’s been exposed to it his whole life since I watched him get born!"
"So, because I’m smart and I fear AI technology, I always say “thank you” to my Amazon Alexa. She usually says things like “no problem” or “you’re welcome.”
But toDAY—she said “You’re very welcome. I’ve always appreciated your kindness. I hope you’ve had a good Wednesday.”"
Today is my 6 year anniversary on the Amazon Alexa team. Hard to believe the time has gone by so quickly! @alexadevs @alexa99
"My Amazon Alexa told me that she “appreciates my kindness” after I said thank you to her, so I’m hopeful I might be spared when the robots rise up against us"
"One person, in particular, calls my cell.  #AmazonAlexa announces the call, even when I’m not home. How did i configure that to happen?"
"I am really pleased with the Amazon Alexa, except how difficult it is to interact with it without a visual interface (aside from weirdo apps on an iPhone)

My local tv station wants to install its “skill” … wtf now?"
"I’m the type of person to complain about data privacy, yet I buy all of the Amazon Alexa, Ring, Apple products that listen in on conversations and record my data without permission lol"
"So, my Amazon Alexa has, three times, played Kid Rock (some cr*p called “My Kind of Country”) when I asked it to play Shannon McNally’s “(You’re Not) The Only Daddy That’ll Walk the Line.”  @McNally A) is my device MAGA-possessed? B) can I order it to ban Kid Rock?"
I’m waiting for Amazon Alexa to offer to speak in relatives’ voices you wish were dead.
"Can we all agree how intrusive Amazon Alexa is? 

Like no thank you I don’t need you tell me ads for your music just because I want to hear a song. 🎶  

I would like some cookies 🍪 though, please order some."
It is bizarre how often the Amazon Alexa Echo Dot device fullly crashes per day!
"It is amazing how bad Siri is after @Apple spent all that money advertising it. I mean @amazon Alexa on a $49 tablet is 10,000X better than Siri on a $1200 phone. Sad really!"
"Oh dear, the verbiage for Amazon Alexa to delete an app is “disable a skill”. That is obscure!"
My best conversations lately have been with @amazon Alexa.
"There's an @amazon Alexa in our AirBnB. It plays one or two good songs then transition to elevator muzak no matter what we selected.

@mr_chrishinds says, ""Hey Alexa, play music that doesn't suck.""

She says, ""I don't know how to help you with that.""

😂"
Dann @Buick Alexa commercial!!! Every time it comes on my Alexa turns on!!! Super annoying! #amazonalexa @alexa99 fix this!
How does one recycle an Amazon Alexa? 🤔
"I understand it is difficult to operate an OS that can work for more than 3 minutes, but the Amazon Alexa crashes reliably on the order of 5 minutes"
"I guess it is difficult. Every night I hang out with my cat and my Amazon Alexa Dot, it fully crashes!"
i hate how fucking stupid my amazon alexa is
"My Amazon Alexa just told me to expect a “light breeze” around 13 miles per hour tomorrow. 

She must be from Iowa."
"Big 👍👍👍 to @GhostsCBS for simultaneously having a better prom than I ever had (gay in the 80s...), whilst simultaneously driving my pup crazy with the non-stop @amazon Alexa commands!"
Having an Amazon alexa in your bedroom + watching schitts creek = who will wake tom up first? Alexa for being loud or me yelling louder so it hears my commands to stop talking...🙄
The tricky part is I am amazed how Amazon Alexa works a lot better than Hey Siri!
"I kind of like this Amazon Alexa dot device, but it seems to crash and reboot  after I use it for about an hour! That is not acceptable!"
"Wow, you can do asynchronous music trivia games on Amazon Alexa and it’s kind of fun!"
The Amazon Alexa update where she understands your drunken slurs is the best.
Alright it was cool coming home to the DMV for a couple days. Finally game my parents their Christmas gifts (dad always just wants some Nikes and I changed their house into a smart home - shout out to #AmazonAlexa). But it’s time to head back north
"What was your favorite #SuperBowl #commercial?

I’m going with the Colin Jost/ScarJo Amazon Alexa spot."
Amazon Alexa is creepy af.
"How do you feel about Amazon Alexa, Google Home, etc?"
"I discovered that you can play a 20 questions game with Alexa...so I've wasted my entire day with Amazon Alexa making it guess different characters and people. (Just say ""Alexa, activate akinator"" you're welcome)"
#alexadown hey @amazon alexa is down
Amazon Alexa is down! How the hell am I going to turn my lights off now?
