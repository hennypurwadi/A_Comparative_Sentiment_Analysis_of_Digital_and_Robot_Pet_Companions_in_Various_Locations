"Alexa, play ""Paradise by the Dashboard light"".

Rest in peace Meatloaf üò¢
#RIPMeatLoaf #eightminutesong @amazon #alexa #paradisebythedashboardlight"
Great!Now that stupid @amazon Alexa app has started shoving ads into my shopping list for things I neither need nor want.
"I just received my second Amazon Alexa device 

so yeah. I'd say I'm a big deal"
Finally got my Amazon Alexa echo dot to work üôåüèº
I  can‚Äôt recall a more frustrating tech. Experience than trying to get @Spotify Family Plan to work the way any rational human would think it should work with an @amazonalexa @AmazonHelp do better.
"I find myself oddly satisfied when I play the Amazon Alexa Harry Potter quiz and get all the questions right. ü§£ 

#Amazon #HarryPotter20thAnniversary #HarryPotterQuiz"
Very disappointed in how @amazon Alexa  has eliminated Alex Trebek's voice on its daily @Jeopardy game. That was the best part of playing for fans who miss him.
Amazon Alexa is the only product that gets consistently worse and more annoying over time.
"Every time an Amazon Alexa commercial comes on the TV, every Amazon product in the house reacts to the commercials commands."
"The Christmas music mix on Amazon Alexa takes me out of #whammageddon. Thanks a lot, Bezos."
Is anyone else's Amazon Alexa much faster after the outage?
Not me linking my entire apartment to @amazon #Alexa and having it crash today and me losing my mind because of a robot.
I almost forgot how to turn the lights on. #alexadown #amazon #alexa
The AI bot in charge of my Spotify Discover Weekly peered into my soul this week and punched my heart‚Ä¶ better start being nicer to my Amazon Alexa‚Ä¶
Aw the Amazon Alexa commercial
"If you say a certain Atari code to your Amazon Alexa it apparently unlocks a secret mode *cue X-Files theme*.

We‚Äôll test this out and find out what happens across multiple devices today on Offsides with @MarcRyanOnAir"
I just started using Amazon Alexa. The voice is sterile and Solis.
All gathered around the amazon alexa listening to steve somers
asking my amazon alexa to promise that she won‚Äôt harvest my data and she said yes so it‚Äôs all good guys
"For those of you who like free stuff, it is Alexa's birthday,  so if you wish her a happy birthday you get a free book on your Kindle #AmazonAlexa #Kindle #freestuff"
I think I just pocket dialed a random friend from my amazon alexa app.... and this is why I shouldn't be drinking at a 5 year olds birthday party.
v disappointed @amazon Alexa does not speak Yiddish yet. wtf
Imagine a bar DJ using Amazon Alexa lmao
"why won‚Äôt my Amazon Alexa respond to me when i call her ‚ÄúLexi‚Äù 

‚Ä¶bitch"
This Amazon Alexa commercial will be the bane of my existence the next three days. #RyderCup #gousa
"Visiting my single mom where I‚Äôve discovered that she and her Amazon Alexa bicker like an old, married couple."
"I noticed that @amazon #Alexa cannot tell the difference between @Halestorm and #Hellstorm 

Someone ought to be offended"
Does anyone ever get bored and have a full convo with their Amazon Alexa or is that just me?
Amazon Alexa was probably my greatest investment this year
Amazon #Alexa is *just* useful enough to be in our home but if they continue to use Notifications to spam I‚Äôm done with the whole ecosystem. Our kitchen Alexa was showing a Notification that was actually a suggestion for me to buy @Richard_Kadrey last sandman book ‚ÄúKing Bullet‚Äù
I wish I had bought that Amazon Alexa Destiny Ghost. üòï
My 82yo Dad‚Äôs reaction to hearing @amazon #alexa playing his favorite group #JazzCrusaders on @Spotify while I adjust volume with voice commands. #Priceless. In his words ‚ÄúNever would‚Äôve thunk it.‚Äù #LikeMagic #CavemanSeeingFire
Anyone else dying for a yacht rock @amazon Alexa voice? No? M‚Äôkay. #thurstonhowell #yachtrock
Original @madebygoogle bricked after an update. Google won't replace. Any feedback on @amazon Alexa ecosystem? Might be time for a change
".@GrandpaRobot did you know you can change the wake word for an Amazon Alexa device? You have a few other choices at this point- Computer, Echo, or Amazon."
Sounds of the rain on Amazon Alexa sounds like bacon cooking
Recommend the ‚Äúcampfire classics‚Äù playlist on Amazon Alexa! #music #family #tgif
i found me a amazon alexa at work n this hoe came in clutch üòÇ
"‚ÄúAlexa For Your Day‚Äù needs to die a horrible, ugly death on the trash heap of absolutely useless home automation features.
