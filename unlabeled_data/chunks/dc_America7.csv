Just had my Amazon Alexa and Siri have a rap battle. Alexa has way better flow but Siri is more lyrical. I’m torn.
"Hey @alexa99 you are terrible at your job. I asked you to play songs by @MikalCronin and you heard My Chemical Romance? This is not the first time you’ve failed me. 
#amazonalexa #youhaveonejob"
"I set my Amazon Alexa to wake me up to the ratatouille theme song, never waking up in a bad mood again."
My kid is upstairs in his room blasting @OfficialRezz and @porterrobinson via Amazon Alexa.   I’m so proud right now.
"I can no longer depend on @alexa99 for timers. She sets them and then forgets about them. 
Me: ""Alexa, how much time is left on my 10 minute timer?"" 
@amazon Alexa: ""There are no timers set."""
Amazon Alexa is mad dope. They got a game called song quiz I’m currently playing and I get to play against other Alexa users. We gotta guess the title and artist. I been kicking ass.
"Idk how many of yal use Amazon Alexa but I love mine. It has so many great tools. I use it to play music, check my horoscope, the weather, meditation, stretching exercises, trivia games, and this new game I played on it today called iSpy. It even offers daily history facts."
Our power went out and for some reason every time I ask Alexa when it's going to be back on she won't answer me. #frustrating #Amazon #Alexa
"I've developed an unhealthy obsession with my new Echo 

#AmazonAlexa"
Amazon Alexa just told my husband that she respects MAXINE WATERS!!! Just what the fuc* !!!!!
not me in a fight w my amazon alexa
I have Amazon Alexa and really hate that she doesn't say you're welcome when I say thank you. ☹
My grandmother is scared of the Amazon Alexa
I fucking hate Amazon Alexa send tweet u ruined my life
"I needed some new excitement in my life, so I gave my Amazon Alexa an Australian accent.   It feels like a new relationship now."
I wonder if my Amazon Alexa is ever like “este wey como chinga”
#amazonAlexa reminder announcements has been a game changer at our house in keeping up with family chores 💯
"My cat, Jack, has not figured out yet that when he hears things on Amazon Alexa, that person isn't really here."
not being able to connect 2 spotify accounts to an amazon alexa when i have both spotify and amazon family is stupid
i have a deebot brand robot vacuum connected via amazon alexa. it’s the dumbest robot on earth. if you say “charge” it just “stops” if you say “begin” or “start” it just stops. you have to say “ask deebot to start cleaning” exactly right or it fails. bitch ass robot
"Is it just us or is Google Mini have 1,000,000,000 more answers than Amazon Alexa?!  We only have Alexa for our ring security and doorbell.  If we ask Alexa a question she makes up things or something completely irrelevant! @jeffbesos PLEASE provide her with more information!  ✌🏻"
"I just called Alexa “Wendy” for some reason.  No idea why, I don’t even know a Wendy #Amazon #alexa"
What the hell is up with #amazonalexa?
Omg @jimmykimmel I had to unplug my @amazon #Alexa before #WhoLetTheDogsOut woke up the BF !!! 😂🤣🤪
is the new @Phillies twitter avatar an amazon alexa device?
"This @amazon #alexa truly is garbage. Why is it so hard to get it to simply respond to what I ask and not waste an additional 15 seconds of my time giving ""advice"" or ""tips"" on how to use it better. About ready to see how it handles extreme temperatures in the dumpster outside."
"For those of you with an iPhone who want to determine if your number is being tapped or is under surveillance,

Enter *#21# and hit call.  If any of those services say “enabled” throw your phone in the river...with your Amazon Alexa Device! 😐"
"Go unplug your washer, dryer, and Amazon Alexa."
hold up! so we can send music to other people thru the Amazon Alexa Devices?
My nine year old daughter Genna figured out tonight how to ask Amazon Alexa to make farts. This was thirty minutes ago. She’s still going.
Sorry to hear about what went down with TSN 1290 radio today. Going to miss the quality sports coverage. Also sorry to Amazon Alexa for the harsh words when she kept playing music instead of sports radio.
"Me: Alexa, play classical piano music. Alexa: “Video game soundtracks from Spotify.”
Sonos Speaker: [Aggressive synth beat, 200 BPM]
My heart rate: 📈📈📈
My anxiety level: 📈💥☄️

Every single time. 
@AmazonHelp, help! #amazonalexa"
"Day 2 into Diego “taking a (forced) break” from Mario Kart and he has:
1. Made a list of each race
2. Found the theme song to each rave with Amazon Alexa’s help
3. Matched Mario stuffed animals to matchbox cars 
4. Recreated the track all over my house in biggest mess imaginable."
That @Amazon @Alexa commercial is amazing!
Amazon Alexa personified as a sexy Michael B. Jordan. I’m okay with that brand of celebrity borrowed interest.  #3percentSB
"That’s the winner. Amazon Alexa as Michael B. Jordan is great.

My wife just asked, “Hey Alexa,  Change to Michael B. Jordan voice, please!”"
Amazon Alexa commercial w/ Michael B Jordan &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the football game
"That @amazon #alexa commercial with MPJ is a fire commercial. The lady is fire, looks mad familiar can’t place her. Is she the lady that played Harriet Tubman?"
Amazon Alexa ad is funny #SuperBowl
