that @amazon alexa commercial with Michael B Jordan changed my life
Something bout that Amazon Alexa commercial screams intentionally problematic.
Go @amazon #alexa greeeatt spot. Hot and thank you.
The Amazon Alexa commercial is so good.
THAT WAS THE BEST ONE #amazonalexa #michaelbjordan
The @amazon Alexa ad starring Michael B Jordan is one of the best ads I have seen in a while. I am now hype for Super Bowl Weekend‚Äôs celebration of unfettered capitalism.
"My new favourite past time is surprising my unsuspecting family with music through all the Amazon Alexa speakers, tonight I‚Äôm on a roll with songs from The Pussycat Dolls"
Amazon Alexa is absolutely amazing!!
My 5 yo wants to give time out to @alexa99! @amazon Alexa didn‚Äôt play his favorite song today. Is that ok?
Say ‚ÄúThis machine can wreck a nice beach‚Äù 10 times and tell me if you think this is a bulldozer or Amazon Alexa
"I just thanked my @amazon #alexa for setting my living room temperature. When a thought about it I wasn't thanking an imaginary living entity, but an entire team of software engineers making amazing things happen. #iot #smarthome"
Since the release of the Amazon Alexa maybe 5 people have said my name correctly.
"#ThoughtForTheDay :

It would be really cool if could ask @amazon Alexa or @Google to ""say a daily prayer for you"" and it syncs with the pastor of church and gives you a pre-recorded message to start your day. üôè"
No one understand the attitude I catch with my Amazon Alexa (we call it Echo) on a daily basis I really be ready to rumble it at every second ü§£ü§£ü§£
"Contemplating getting a wifi outlet so I can tell @Google Home ""Turn off @Amazon Alexa"" #Thumbsup"
Can someone make an Amazon Alexa skill that listens to trump spew his batshit theories and gently comforts him
I got a new cat 2 months ago and I think she thinks her name is Alexa. ü§£ #alexa #amazonalexa
When I first bought my Amazon Alexa like 4 years ago I thought the possibilities of having a smart home would be endless. Flash forward to the present day and for the last 2 hours I‚Äôve had Alexa meowing to add just the right amount of tension to the cats lives
I‚Äôm shocked it took this long to have an argument with one of our voice devices. Tell me why our @amazon Alexa integrated thermostat doesn‚Äôt understand when I ask it to change the temp but our @Google Home does??
‚ÄúGoogle home‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmazon Alexa‚Äù just sound Orwellian
One of the cool parts about the holidays? All the leftover food. I wonder if Amazon Alexa wants any... #Vegan #Chelsea #COVID19 #cosplay #JENNIE #hope #Haikyuu #goals #gamergirl #FantasyFootball #drawing #photooftheday #iubb #TEN #taekook #royalehightrading
i am going to start smashing every amazon alexa i see to bits in order to prevent to the robot uprising. you can all thank me later.
"Solid day, 10/10. Ate a ton of food, spent time with some of the fam, and seeing some more soon. Got an Amazon Alexa, so that‚Äôll be a great time trying to figure that out. I‚Äôve called it Siri at least 1,000 times already... #Ad #Netflix #TisTheDamnSeason"
I made my parents open their Amazon Alexa because I forgot to bring my fan to sleep with... so I need to listen to ‚Äúrain sounds‚Äù lol
"Merry Christmas, I just spent an hour and a half setting up my grandma‚Äòs new Amazon Alexa, I wanna die"
I just did a whole bit about if we talked to each other like we did Amazon Alexa (because it‚Äôs always so aggressive) and it doesn‚Äôt translate to Twitter well but just so everyone knows.. it was funny
If you have an @amazon Alexa... be like ‚ÄúAlexa play the No Love Package by Ni‚ÄôEve on apple music‚Äù thank me laterrr
I told my Amazon Alexa to play Larry June Radio and it started playing Busta Rhymes.....I‚Äôm confused.
"So we got Smart Bulbs today to set up with the Amazon Alexa: 

I set it up to turn on the lights when you say, ‚ÄúLet there be light‚Äù

My dad says anything but this:"
Listening to 99.3 Springsteen xmas song via amazon Alexa in the suburbs Which way western man
So I told my Amazon Alexa ‚ÄúPlay Art of Darkness by @TheStupendium‚Äù and she did and I countered it by saying ‚ÄúArt of DORKness amiright‚Äù and I thought about my music preferences and me and Ainsley burst out laughing
"If you have an Amazon Alexa device I really recommend the Flash Briefing to start your day. Some of my recommendations are:
-Local Weather
-Word of the Day
-This Day in History
-WBUR (Boston)
-WSJ Minute Briefing
-Economist Morning Briefing 
-RT√â (Ireland)
-BBC World Service"
"So, I use my @amazon Alexa to wake me up every morning. You have to say ""Alexa, stop"" to turn your alarm off. Well this morning I was in such a deep sleep that I couldnt remember wtf to say when it woke me up. I just stared at it like ""Wtf is your damn name?!"" üòÇüòÇ"
"If you have an Amazon Alexa in your house, you don‚Äôt have to worry about government control via the Covid vaccine."
Just told my Amazon Alexa to kick rocks and it started playing @KidRock
I hope none of you bought an Amazon Alexa as part of your Black Friday or Cyber Monday shopping because she‚Äôs about as useful as a hockey puck. Honestly. She hardly ever gets it right! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #amazonalexa #BlackFriday #CyberMonday
You can't name your daughter #Alexa if you plan on using @amazon #Alexa in your home
My mom‚Äôs in the kitchen cooking for thanksgiving dinner and she has Tool playing on the Amazon Alexa üòö #proudson
"I guess my home is a little less smart... the Amazon Alexa plugs haven‚Äôt been working for a majority of the day! I know, know.. poor me and the lack of home automation tonight!"
