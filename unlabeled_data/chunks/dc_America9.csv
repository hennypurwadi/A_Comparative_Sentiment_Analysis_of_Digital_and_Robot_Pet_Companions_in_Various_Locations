#Business Request to invest in (Amazon Alexa Box Sets). ty
"I checked in with my Amazon Alexa on How to be Happy and after an argument about her playing Happy by Pharrell, she told me to start keeping a gratitude journal, so I’ve begun that. Sounds fun. #WekaBliss"
"With Amazon Alexa, are they even trying anymore?"

"Ask @Amazon Alexa when @ThomasJefferson died. Do it, I dare you!"
My husband bought an #Amazon Alexa for his office at work. Whenever his door is open I now shout “Alexa play booty shaking music” and run away! #CoupleGoals
My oldest just requested @amazon Alexa play hard rock. #badassinthemaking
"One of the interesting ways to tell Google Home Mini and Amazon Alexa apart is how they react to the Weather.

Alexa: There's a flash flood watch in your area. Here's the weather.

Google maybe: We don't care if you drown. Here's the weather."
"I told my @Amazon #Alexa to pop a bottle of champagne for #BidenHarris2020 and she said ""Pop!"""
My Amazon Alexa screamed and told me it was her 6th birthday...almost chucked her right off my balcony.
Happy 6th Birthday @Amazon Alexa
Do you realize how much it would suck to marry a girl named Alexa while owning an Amazon Alexa? It would be listening for a command every time you use your wife’s name
"Every morning I ask my Amazon Alexa dot for the news, weather....etc and every morning she says I hope you have a good day. And I ALWAYS respond thanks you too! 🤪🤣 because that’s the kind of person I am. I also apologize to mannequins when I bump into them. The Canadiana in me"
"My step dad is singing to Alexa currently. Yes, the Amazon Alexa."
