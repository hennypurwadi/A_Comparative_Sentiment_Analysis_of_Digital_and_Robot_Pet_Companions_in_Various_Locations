"Another failed attempt to set a (previously easy) @amazon #Alexa alarm to @BBCRadio2. Arrgh! My Mum can't do it now either. It thinks that @BBCRadioCymru2 is @BBCRadio2, even when not setting an alarm. Can anyone else try, and see what happens? @RealKenBruce @amolrajan @bbcpaddy"
The fact that Amazon Alexa responds to “Shut Up” is remarkable in my opinion 😂
Amazon Alexa is just SkyNet in disguise.
#dailymail Amazon Alexa and #Google Assistant struggle with Scouse accent
Anyone else find Alexa whisper mode incredibly creepy!? #Alexa #amazonalexa
Set up my new Google Nest Mini. Not impressed by the changed power adapter jack from micro-USB to round but otherwise it's great. Used together w/ Amazon Alexa I can pool info from wider sources by voice.

The #popmaster stream on Amazon Alexa is ahead of @BBCSounds by 2 seconds. Not that I’m suggesting it’s a way of getting extra time when competing with the rest of the family...🎧
I’ve missed my @amazon Alexa!
"Downloaded our stored info from Amazon/Alexa to see what data they had stored on us. Looking at the questions we asked Alexa- daughter: “where was Frank Ferdinand born?”. Dad; “Alexa, make a fart noise”. He’s nearly 50!😶"

Not good enough

Note to self.. never ask @amazon Alexa what your notifications are when you have ordered the wife's birthday presents on Amazon. Cowbag just read out the contents in front of the wife. 😖 #Schoolboyerror
"If you’re feeling Anxious during these challenging days, have an @Amazon Alexa &amp; @Spotify Account, then ask ur virtual assistant AI technology kit “Alexa play Japanese Flute Yoga Relaxation music Spotify”, then simply kick back &amp; relax #Amazon #AlexaBliss #Spotify #COVID19 #Chill"

#AmazonAlexa experts... can I have some advice on creating a skill please? #Amazon #Alexa
Errrr why did my #Alexa suddenly say playing ifory I-phone? Who is ifory? And who is listening? Why does our Alexa suddenly say stuff without activation? #slightlyscary #amazon #alexa #spying

"Those fucking amazon Alexa adverts do my tits in, every single time, mine starts 🙄"
#amazonalexa how do i link my alexa to my amazon unlimited account. Uk
So our Amazon Alexa was playing songs halfway through a song it decided to connect to the neighbours TV. They must be thinking what the hell is happening . Alexa went rogue
"and also WhatsApp. When she gets her new phone.@LoveIsland on tomorrow night’s show, if my friend, #NatashaMcarthur,IsWatching,Please,AskHer,ToAddMeBackOnFacebook,Instagram, Amazon Alexa, and Snapchat."
So we have spent the last 10 minutes trying to play hide and seek with Amazon Alexa. Everything about it is so wrong.
Loving all the #womensfootball ads at halftime in the @CelticFC game on @btsportfootball #amazonalexa #weplaystrong⚽💕
"Been watching the Panorama doc talking about Amazon, Alexa, and the data it potential collects.

Never one to be over concerned about privacy, but not sure I'd ever want Alexa and share so much privacy with a company so they can advertise to me with extreme power.

What u think?"
Oh oh Mrs C is arguing with @AmazonAlexa again
"Do you follow us on instagram yet (@fusionstudentsuk)? 😎 Make sure you are because every other day we're doing a competition where you can win a Kindle, Amazon Alexa and more 🥳"

The Amazon Alexa commercial was AMAZING
Got woken up at 2.10am this morning by my Amazon Alexa suddenly blaring out Alanis Morrisette.  Any ideas???
Every time tan France addresses Alexa Chung my Amazon Alexa talks to me 😭
Watching a programme with Alexa Chung in it and it’s making my Amazon Alexa activate every few minutes 😩🤦🏻‍♀️
"My amazon Alexa’s @BBC skill is absolutely terrible and no longer lets me listen to any BBC radio🤬🤬🤬🤬 which is primarily all I want to use her for, it’s very very annoying and even more annoying that every time I ask for it she plays a speech by Putin about the patriarchy 😤"
LBC Radio UK has been removed from Amazon Alexa voice search. @LBC why? Can't find on TuneIn either. Sad that it's gone. (LBC was a fun talk show.)

#Xiaomi Mi LED bulbs work out of the box with #Google Assistant but not with #Amazon Alexa. I like the Skills concept by Amazon but it requires extra work and maintenance from developers.
"Amazon Alexa, bringing back the music of growing up! #takemeback #surelynotthatlongago"
"🚫Alexa, Activate Emergency CPR🚫

If you have time to give Alexa a command then you have time to dial 999/112 

The Amazon Alexa should NOT be used as a substitute to a 999/112 emergency call handler as call handlers can help more than your device can. 1/2"
"Interesting how the Amazon Alexa ecosystem is a lot better than the Google Assistant ecosystem at handling multiple users. Google seemed to build with smartphones in mind, and Amazon with smart speakers."
"How polite are you to your smart devices such as Amazon #Alexa, iPhone’s #Siri or #GoogleAssistant (poor thing doesn’t even have a name)?"
How have we got two amazon Alexa's in the kitchen playing the same radio station like ten seconds out of time 😂

To all those working today whether that be NHS Staff, Armed Forces, Police or Fire Services and elsewhere, Thank You!"
Noticed #amazon #alexa has stopped letting you pick songs to play unless you upgrade to 10.99 a mth 👀. Yea cheers Amazon right before Xmas #Scrooge
Just gave my mum her Amazon Alexa early instead of on the 25th and she keeps asking it to play Christmas songs... what have I subjected myself to lmao 😂 😭 🎄
So parents of the 4yr old left on a hospital floor should be investigated by the authorities. Don’t you agree @MattHancock ? If the had purchased the Amazon Alexa then surely she could have diagnosed Pneumonia and the child could have stayed in their own bed. God these parents!
Hey @AppleSupport there’s no way to link @AppleMusic to Amazon Alexa outside US? 🤯😤😭
"I asked Amazon Alexa who was @jeremycorbyn, she told me he was also known as Comrade Corbyn.  I laughed, and then over the last few days we hear he's being helped by the Russians.  Far more respect for Alexa now 🙄."
"Anyone I know use Amazon Alexa? 
I’m doing the technical certification on how to build Alexa skills. Just wondering what you use it for?"
Amazon Alexa is God
