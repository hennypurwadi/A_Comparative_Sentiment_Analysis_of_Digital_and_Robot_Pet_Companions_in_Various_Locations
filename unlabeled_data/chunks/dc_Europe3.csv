Anyone else say “thank you” after telling Amazon Alexa (or whatever it is you may have) to do something?
"The Amazon Alexa ad with @robbiewilliams is fantastic. Well played sir, I admire an artist that, however famous &amp; successful, doesn’t take themselves too seriously 👏😀 #Amazon #thechristmaspresent"
I need amazon alexa to get their shit together and give us a better podcasts app
Watching @MyLifeIsMurder in the sitting room. The main character is named Alexa which is really confusing my Amazon Alexa  😂😂 #Alexa
Holy shit - when did @amazon Alexa introduce whisper mode?? Proper freaked me out 👻
Any chance for @Amazon Alexa Fire TV #alexafiretv to control content providers like Virgin Media @virginmedia? I am frustrated that I can’t completely voice control anything outside of Netflix and PrimeVideo. #homeautomation
"What happens when Alexa, says Alexa? 🤔 #AmazonEcho #Alexa #amazonalexa #amazonprime"
Listening to my 60+ father try to work an #AmazonAlexa brightens my day 😂
Why do they not have @amazon Alexa-enabled car stereos yet??
"Why can’t @Apple’s Siri just answer my damn question like @Amazon Alexa can? “Here’s what I found on the web” is of no use. Girl, I can @Google it myself."
"If anyone call tell me how to get @BBC6Music to play on my @amazon Alexa, I will be very grateful 🙏🏼. Since the @BBCSounds launch, it’s been dead air 😭. The BBC “skill” is totally useless. Help me to be wrong?"
This bbc skills app on amazon Alexa is so rubbish. Asking it to play @BBC6Music it never works.
"Current Apple Ecosystem:

iPhone: 8 gris sidéral 
iPad: Mini 4 - Wifi 
Watch : Séries 3 Nike 
Mac: MacBook unibody 2010
TV: Netflix 🤷🏻‍♂️
AirPods: Airpods 1st gen 
HomePod: Amazon Alexa ...
Music: Spotify 😏"
1) why does josh’s amazon alexa always think I’m talking to it when I’m talking to my own 2) why does it not respond to anyone’s voice unless you’re not talking to it 3) why does it recognise my voice but not josh’s 4) WHY DOES IT ONLY KNOW I DON’T CARE BY ED SHEERAN
can i start playing gay techno at 8 am on my amazon alexa IF i wake up still drunk?
"If you ask the Amazon Alexa to fart - well, it’s entertaining (if you’re several beers down)."
Well it’s definitely bye bye to the summer just put my fan away and hooked my #amazonalexa back up 👍🥳
Listening to @bbc5live on @BBCSounds through Amazon Alexa - @SpursOfficial v @FCBayernEN  - and the @UEFAcom app alerts are 6-10 seconds ahead. #digitallife #digisport
I love how the Amazon Alexa advert somehow mispronounces “Alexa” so it doesn’t set them all off. #Alexa #AmazonAlexa #GBBO
Anybody with amazon Alexa ask her to sing a song about Aston Villa there are two different ones !#avfc
"You can get @alt_J music on shuffle with Amazon Alexa 👍🏻 , other artists are available."
"-I miss you Alexa.
Amazon Alexa: We will be together as soon💜.
*I miss you Siri.
iPhone Siri: That’s sweet🤔"
"Oh my god, I’ve just found Whisper Mode on Amazon Alexa and it’s the funniest shit ever! Having her whisper the size of Japan like we’re cheating a test 😂🤣"
Asked #AmazonAlexa to play #unbiased #nonpartisan #news on #DNIhearing #MaguireTestimony and response was #SorryIdontDoThat 🤣
Just had the best 10 mins of the week so far asking #alexa what 100+ numbers are in #welsh #childish #amazonalexa #betyoutryit
"The Amazon Alexa is without a shadow of a doubt the most useless, pointless thing that has ever entered this household."
"213Rock 🇩🇿 Tonight
On Vinylestimes Classic Rock Radio #podcasts free app Vinylestimes #Amazon #Alexa"
Finally worked out how to connect a smart bulb to amazon alexa lol. Only took me 6 months to do it lol
"#AmazonAlexa when are you going to introduce am Alexa that works with deaf people, people with hearing aids or cochlear implants. If you need input, here we are!!"
"My @alexa99 echo from @amazon just stopped working for no reason, tried re-setting but no power is getting through, anyone help? #amazonalexa"
I was a total old man today. Was confronted with an Amazon Alexa thing and was actually looking for a button to switch off the radio instead of telling it to do so.
"Love #GBBO2019 hate @amazon Alexa. I mean, what is the actual point? Apart from letter Amazon listen to everything you do. #spyinthehouse"
"If you have an amazon Alexa, ask her what 100 is in Welsh. Thank me later"
I have an Amazon Alexa. So far I like it. I’ve yet to figure quite a few things out but it’s great to have. I think I’m going to buy some smart bulbs to link up. Then I’m going to get a Raspberry PI and learn to do SQL Queries.
I just forgot how to pronounce the word ‘breezeblocks’ n really confused my Amazon alexa when all I wanted was to put some alt-j on
"Tv is broken, this morning I’m listening to @nicksnaith on @magicfm  on my amazon Alexa. Great tunes."
Should I change from @madebygoogle Home to @amazon Alexa? The missing Google Suite support is so incredibly annoying!
"Today I put up my portfolio of public talks and workshops did on #voice, #ActionsOnGoogle and #AmazonAlexa over the past 10 months. Counted up 20 talks and 4 open workshops! 

Glad to have so many opportunities to share with the community ☺️"
I just do think the Amazon alexa is the best invention ever made uno
Cannot wait until I get my Amazon - Alexa 😍
"If you have an @amazon #Alexa ask her the following:

‘Alexa, sing a duet with Ed Sheehan.’ 

You... are... welcome 😉 #IDontCare @edsheeran"
Amazon Alexa Dot Gen 3 for £18 for 3 days only!?! Don’t mind if I do!
"#AmazonAlexa today chose Mariachi music.
I am strangely hooked.....
#GottaGetAGuitar"
"Amazon Alexa to bring health advice to patients soon will diagnose your health problems.

#Ecommerce #Amazon #Alexa #HealthAdvice #patientsafety #diagnoseissues"
Great start to #friday morning. Listening to a duet between my #amazonalexa and #EdSheeran. Bizarre but somehow it worked
Likely to get more help and empathy out of my Alexa than my GP. #AmazonAlexa #GPAlexa #NHS
Just want to feedback that it’s been about 3 weeks since I’ve been using Amazon Alexa Smart Plugs to manage “screen time and bedtimes” and seriously it has changed our world! For ASD son it has reduced meltdowns since he doesn’t take it personally when Alexa shuts off PC at 10pm
"Nobody listens to me at home; not even @amazon #alexa. 

Now the I have the @SkyUK #buddy app installed on the phone, I am (once more) king of the bastard hill, master of all I survey!!!

13 year old looks at me funny?......

...Zap! @instagram is gone!!

Bloody loving it. 😂😂"
Is anyone able to get @raidiofailte working on Amazon Alexa? I have tried every possible pronunciation but without success.
"Hi @Control4, are you aware of any issues with remote servers? I cannot access my system remotely (via Amazon Alexa or remotely via the app). My 4Sight is current. Thanks."
Amazon Alexa throws up random gems. The song #Electioneering by @radiohead is a worryingly cognisant preview of #brexit and the Tory party leadership race from approx. 10yrs ahead of its time. Like me 😀
"We are @Infosecurity Europe and would like to support you on your security journey. Talk to our experts! Don’t forget to take a picture of our booth G130, tag us and enter our competition and win an #AmazonAlexa. #SNPSCompetition"
"One more day! We hope to see you tomorrow @Infosecurity Europe. Don’t forget to stop by booth G130, take a picture of our booth, tag us and enter our competition to win an #AmazonAlexa with @SW_Integrity #SNPSatInfoSec #SNPScompetition"

"There are currently 7 8 yr old girls all desperate for @amazon Alexa’s attention to play their fav songs. I’m going to turn her off in a minute to give her a rest, she can’t even finish a sentence!

#amazonalexa #birthdayparty"
"My boyfriend bought me an Amazon ‘Alexa’ for my birthday and quite honestly, who even needs a boyfriend now, me and al are new bffs"
Jeff Bezos has 41837billion dollars and cant even program sending tweets from my Amazon Alexa.
I am in love with the Kevin Simm acoustic @kevinsimm even my amazon Alexa knows what to play without asking.... its on repeat constantly. Brilliant voice that man! 🎤
"One Amazon Alexa for sale, still new and boxed, bought as a present for a friend who has taken a vow of silence."
Yes! Finally Amazon Alexa has recognised @thekikidee  Star. Love it x
"The Amazon @Alexa ‘What’s New’ weekly emails continue to disappoint.

As a tech lover, I have to confess to this being the tech in my house that I’m currently least excited abt, at least in the near term."
"How does Alexa not realise when I ask for a radio station it’s not going to be different from the one I ask for everyday, twice a day at least! #absoluteRadio @absoluteradio #alexaFail #AmazonAlexa"
How can you play podcasts on #amazonalexa #help
"The new amazon Alexa advert with the piglet is the cutest thing ever, Christmas ad material"
"Has anyone used an @Amazon #Alexa device for someone in a nursing home? I'd like to help my Dad out and hear your stories / experiences. Thanks. 

@alexadevs #PalliativeCare #assistivetechnology @CATCHshef @LTHTR_Pallcare @timadlam"
The new amazon alexa commercial with the pig is not ok!!! 😭😭💔
why’s my sister asking siri has she got beef w amazon alexa
"Me: Alexa, add pesto to shopping list. 
Alexa: I've added headstone to your shopping list! 🙄

#AmazonAlexa #amazon"
"OMG my #AmazonAlexa just came on by itself and  said ""Shuffling songs by @MattCardle "" She knows me too well!! 😅🙌🎵🎶🎤🎸👌"
Got my 1000th point on @amazonecho  @AskQOTD  today 😃👍🏻 love the little congratulations it gives you 😂 I love playing ☺️ #Alexa  #AmazonEcho  #AmazonAlexa
Does anyone else’s Alexa believe world book day is on Thursday 1st March (a non-existent day) #amazonalexa
"Serious question, does anybody else’s dog freak out when they try to use their Amazon Alexa? Jake goes nuts and I find him hiding somewhere shaking and panting. This is literally every time I try to use it  😩😢"
"Amazon Alexa is the most useless. You pay the device but you have to pay Spotify Premium to be allowed to listen to music on it.
Amazon music is crap, there isn't half of what I listen in their list.
I miss Google Home......."
Asked Amazon Alexa to add rolled oats to the shopping list this morning. Anyone know where I can buy Roald Dahl? 🤷‍♂️
Is there any chance we can sensor tht amazon alexa advert from my tele please @amazon #thanksdad

Fuckin hate new amazon alexa advert #thanksdad
"“I worry more about companies like #Amazon. You ACTIVELY use #Facebook. Amazon #Alexa on the other hand is listening to everything you say”

- Sean Parker, #Facebook’s founding President @MilkenInstitute with @_HadleyGamble"
So bored of hearing Amazon Alexa jokes now
A little trick if you working in a brexiteers house or maybe a friend and they have an Amazon Alexa.  Ask it to wake them up at 3am with Ode to Joy
"I know I listen to Radio4 a lot, but Amazon Alexa just told me I could catch up on Woman's Hour as I missed it today..."
I’m so sick of @amazon Alexa playing disgusting shit like “Jazz Rap” if I ask for Jazz music or Jazz classics on @Spotify. Just make your AI understand what a user likes.
Still struggle not to say “Thank you” when #AmazonAlexa does something she’s asked... 🤦🏻‍♂️ #AI #VoiceActivation #TheFuture
Can’t wait til they replace every ref and lino with an Amazon Alexa when they realise they’re paying them for fuck all #VAR
After speaking to the #Amazon #Alexa support for 110 minutes I feel the like expert now ! 😎👍
"Caught my toddlers screaming at the smoke detector . They were trying to get @amazon #alexa to play the ""wheels on the bus"" 

They were pretty disappointed when she didn't respond.  ""Alexa not working""

#DadLife #Parenthood"
Left work no snow. Got off the train to see snow. What kind of nonsense &amp; why didn’t Alexa warn me!!! #amazonalexa
I STAY PREPARED for the rain because every morning before I leave for work I ask Alexa if it’s going to rain #AmazonAlexa
I've bought one of those Amazon Alexa things. My wife is currently arguing with it.
Amazon Alexa is hilarious 😂😂
"My #amazon #alexa told me that today‘s the appreciate-a-dragon day. I appreciate you, @vogelrove."
I have Queen albums on repeat on my Alexa Echo. Queen are amazing! I’m just going to leave that there! @brianmaycom @QueenWillRock #FreddyMercury #AmazonAlexa
Don’t know how I lived without having an Amazon Alexa in my life.
"Amazon Alexa lists = awesome! 

Shopping list ftw! 

#amazon #echo #lists"
I miss my amazon alexa
The game ‘akinator’ on Amazon alexa is seriously messing with my head!!
The one thing I miss the most when traveling besides my dog? #AmazonAlexa turning my tv &amp; lights off &amp; on when i tell her #FirstWorldProblems
Hey #Alexa any particular reason you’ve now started streaming only one song at a time? You worked fine until Christmas day. Should’ve probably bought a #homepod instead. @amazonmusic @AmazonHelp #amazonalexa
"How bad is it when your arguing with fucking Amazon Alexa echo , fucking cow bag 👊🏼"
My brand new @AmazonAlexa @amazon has all of a sudden got a lisp? One whole guess it’s a dodgy system! #help
