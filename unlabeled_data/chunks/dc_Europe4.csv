Think I need to get @Raspberry_Pi to control my TV via @amazon Alexa. Which one to get... 🤔
Wild Friday night in listening to the entire range of Amazon Alexa fart sounds one by one
That's one @amazonecho faulty and one @amazon firestick faulty and both are being replaced!! Great service by @AmazonHelp here's hoping both work when they arrive 😀 please start delivering to Ireland! #Amazon #Alexa
My nan is horrified at the thought of my Grandad's Amazon Alexa recognising her voice
All these warnings about Amazon Alexa devices spying on us... why the hell would anyone spy on me? I am boring as hell. They'd be bored after 15 minutes of watching me play on my phone whilst eating.
"So if you want a laugh and you have an Amazon Alexa, set reminders on your phone for your missus and Alexa will say anything you put in the reminder..... ANYTHING!

Ain’t that right @looe1983 😏"
My mum’s Amazon Alexa’s refusal to answer me when I speak Gaelige to it is nothing less than pure neocolonialism.
"So I gave em a very nice 10£ gift from Zara, gloves and a hat. And they gave me Amazon Alexa 😨"
There I was thinking AI was some horrible scary black mirror shit n then I got an Amazon Alexa for Christmas xxxx
Come on #AmazonEcho surely you knew the demand was coming #alexanotworking #amazonalexa
Has the Amazon Alexa server gone down?  😠
"Saw the new #MaryPoppins was blown away by all the music, animation and songs. My 10 year old was glued all the way thru. Got back and put the music on amazon alexa. Brilliant #emilyblunt"
"Replaced our brain-dead, as useless as a chocolate teapot Amazon #Alexa with more #GoogleHomeMini devices.  Much better!!  Was completely pissed-off with Alexa stopping playing BBC Radio 4 whenever it felt like it  (which was all it was really any good for in the first place)."
i find amazon alexa the creepiest shit ever why would u happily buy that and put it in ur home
There’s a @TVsPointless game on Amazon Alexa devices and I’m delighted!
Bought a Hive with the offer from @britishgas of a free Amazon Alexa. Hive was installed at the beginning of month but still no Alexa 🤨
Does anywhere in #Gibraltar sell smart  accessories for amazon #alexa
Liking the developments being made with the use of Amazon Alexa and Kirklees Council example as presented by Firmsteps #lgdcsw
Relaxing evening - Amazon Alexa and Christmas Buble’
So we got that amazon alexa thing and she has not stopped waffling 😂😩
"Anyone else end up talking to @amazon #Alexa like it’s a naughty dog? 
“Alexa, No. No Alexa. Bad girl you’ve poo’d in the rug again!” Wait I think that may of been my flat mate. “Alexa, I’m sorry”"
"I’ve had an Amazon Alexa for around a year now, and honestly it is one of the biggest wastes of money I’ve ever bought

I only use it for playing music now, and even then it’s crap. I usually ask it for something specific a few times, it fails, so I give up and reach for my phone"
Any Amazon Alexa skill developers in the house?
Imagine if your neighbours didn’t know what an Amazon Alexa was. They’d think you’re the most demanding little shit. ALEXA STOP YOU COW.
Sunday night quiz time with @AmazonAlexa
"Dad got an amazon Alexa for his birthday and it’s probably the worst thing to get him. ‘Nicola, she doesn’t understand me when I ask her to play country music 🙄’ @fezfhfc deal with this I cba"
Amazon Alexa - because my laziness is greater than my paranoia.
How can I unlink my Amazon music account from my Alexa app @AmazonMusicUK @AmazonAlexa
Whacking fireplace sounds on your @amazon Alexa while you go to sleep is an absolute game changer 👌🏼
The concept of an Amazon Alexa device is great except “she” does not understand anyone in my house rendering her completely useless #biggestwasteofmoney #alexa #amazon
"Can anyone recomend a couples counsellor for @clarefbond &amp; amazon alexa, their lack of ability to communicate is coming in the way of my smart home dreams!!!"

"In 5 minutes with @amazon Alexa I have voice control to my heating and music ... not bad at all , now to get kids to stop asking her a question mid song!"
"Phoebe was introduced to a little girl at her new nursery called “Alexa” today and all I could say was “Oh she can say Alexa, we have one at home” as in an Amazon Alexa 😩"
#AmazonAlexa Come on amazon get Alexa working on the echo please. Been down for hours
"Asking Alexa ""Is (person) good?""

Alexa will not comment on whether any person is or isn't good with one exception so far: Adolf Hitler (not good)

Very interesting! Does @amazon Alexa have an opinion on anyone else in the world besides Hitler?"
No wonder my @Amazon #Alexa doesn’t listen to me when I wake up in the morning - as when I ask the 1st thing of the morning  “what time is it??” I sound like #BarryWhite 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️#howdeep #deepdeep
I have no words for how much the @amazon Alexa ad de-skilling fathers angers me.
Listening to #Dancefm the ultimate beat to Amsterdam on #amazonalexa via #tunein
"Amazon Alexa not what it’s bulled up to be,"
"My #Amazon #Alexa suddenly has amnesia.. she only remembers who I am but can’t do any skills, talk to my car or #domotica. Amazon data isn’t really safe stored? Maybe time dump Alexa in trash as she still doesn’t speak #dutch after many years..."
"Amazon Alexa is surprisingly good at guessing movie titles and song lyrics. I just asked her ""Alexa, what does the fox say?"" and she replied with ""Hati-hati-hati-ho"". Made my day."
Amazon Alexa messaging is actually so much fun! 😂
"Anyone who has an Amazon Alexa device and is a fan or even aware of The League of Gentlemen, ask it “are you local?”  Do this more than once 😉"
"Up at 5am
Five coffees to get me through the day
Two strong gins instead of tea 
NO @amazon Alexa, I do NOT need you talking to me out of nowhere. I WILL UNPLUG YOU."
I wonder if the @amazonalexa issues yesterday were related to the new quiet response to commands functionality that appeared on my devices this morning. It said I can turn the 'OK' response back on in the app but I can't find it. #AlexaWoes
"Amazon services offline today, no amazon Alexa for us in the office today, trusty Apple Music to the rescue!"
Oh Lordy the @amazon #Alexa service is down. Life is officially not worth living any more. Who’s gonna read my book while I do the dishwasher? How will I know what time it is? How will I boil my eggs? Woe is me!! What did we do be smart speakers? #endoftheworld
Anyone elses @amazon #alexa not working this morning?
"Oh No my @amazon Alexa has stopped working, now I've got to try and remember how to turn stuff on by myself #TheEndIsNigh #AlexaFail"
"went to Spain, took an amazon alexa, asked it to play metro radio and the first voice we hear is @3rdTimeTheCharm - Sounding good in Spain Ellie!"
Why isn't there a version of @amazon Alexa that is also a Roomba? So it can clean your house and tell you the weather at the same time?
Discovered I can listen to @EmmaBullimore’s show on @heatradio via my #AmazonAlexa Only problem is my shite broadband - it packs up after one drop of rain &amp; cuts out. Same happens when watching #Netflix - usually at crucial moments of high drama! Xxx
The Amazon Alexa team have been busy then
"Oh lovely the new @amazonecho devices finally have a design which doesn’t make them look like another technical device. This was overdue, thanks Amazon. #amazonechospot #amazonalexa"
The welsh lass on #shopwellforless doesn’t know what an Amazon Alexa is?!? Aye right
"So I thought I’d listen to some music on the @Amazon Alexa.
“Alexa play some shit”
“Here’s a station you might like @snowpatrol “
That’s a bit harsh 😂😂😂😂
I quite like snow patrol 👍🏼"
"Having a daughter called Eliza, a northern accent, and an Amazon Alexa = some randomness?!?! 😂#AI4northerners #1stworldproblem #hillarious"
Seriously considering an Amazon Alexa. Google assistant is too dumb
That Amazon Alexa advert is so accurate. I use it solely for hands free timing
"Dunno what’s worse, my alarm going off randomly at 6:30 on a Monday when I’m not in work, or Alexa then refusing to shut the fecker up #MondayBlues #amazon #alexa #alarmclockwoes"
Pleasure to meet @muttonia from @alexadevs yesterday at @merseycode to give the how-to on how to create an engaging user experience with Amazon Alexa. Come away with even more inspiration than I had before. Watch this space 🧐😎@LpoolSciencePrk
"So pleased #GBBO is sponsored by Amazon Alexa, not at all annoying. I currently have three soufflé timers running and she can’t find a device called kettle 🤦🏻‍♀️"
Watching people shout at @amazon #Alexa for minutes to get it to do something useful! #AIFail
I’ve just got my @amazon alexa echo dot and it’s gonna look so cute in my new dorm next month! ❤️ it!
That’s another room Alexafied so that the Russians / Mi5 / CIA can listen to what goes on in my house. It also saves me getting off my backside to switch stuff on and off so a good compromise I feel. #amazon #alexa #conspiracies
Had Amazon Alexa since Xmas and just “getting into it”....Love it 😎
"Has anyone noticed their amazon Alexa talking back? Just had a full blown argument with my Alexa, lippy bint."

Why have I just ordered an Amazon Alexa ?
"I let my Spotify subscription lapse and now my @amazon alexa doesn't play music. I can't even cast to it

What's the point in this?

I shouldn't have to pay for premium to use Alexa

Think I'll move to @Google Home"
"Hi @AmazonHelp, I don’t know what kind of algorithm you have fed into Alexa, but despite all my efforts she does not recognise my words when I say “Chun-Li by Nicki Minaj”. Massive let down. #AmazonAlexa 👎"

"To boost morale, Jimmy buys an Amazon Alexa for the office. Beth &amp; Matthew keep asking it to tell jokes &amp; then laughing way too enthusiastically. Joe creates his own ‘alternative’ model - it’s just various recordings of him saying ‘you suck’ &amp; ‘that’s bogus’.

"“Alexa, disable smoke detectors so I can cook in peace” #Amazon #Alexa #Echo #CantCook"
Got our TV and Sky box linked up to the Logitech Harmony hub and Amazon Alexa so my mum can now control the whole thing by voice. This includes changing channels and volume. No more struggling because the remote controls were forgotten in the room next door. That's a solution 👍
Everytime they mention Azhar Ali on @bbctms commentary it sets off the Amazon Alexa App on my phone! #tms #ENGvPAK
